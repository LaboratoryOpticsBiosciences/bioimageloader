# Dataset overview table
Try to gather nuclei images, if possible in fluorescence images. Many of them
have multi channels; some that use target proteins separtated channels natually
and others like histopathology are nauturally RGB. There are gray scale images
as well.

Annotation avaiability was an important criteria.
